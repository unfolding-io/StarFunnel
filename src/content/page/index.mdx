      ## **Projects & Prizes** Make something great


      At Tribehacks, any kind of project can count as a "hack". Code or no code, if you can make it in a weekend, we want to see what you can do! You can submit your project for judging against a wide variety of categories, or participate in sponsor or cybersecurity challenges.

      ## **Beginners & Experts** TribeHacks is for everyone


      William & Mary's liberal arts model makes this event so exciting. This is an opportunity to use technology to enhance the things you're already interested and skilled in. Whether you've pioneered new machine learning techniques or you've never written a line of code in your life, we've got you covered. We are primarily geared towards college students, but we welcome recent graduates and older high school students as well.

        title: What is a hackathon?
        description: >2
           A hackathon is a weekend-long coding event where students learn new skills, build interesting projects, and have fun! We will have free merch, free food, and industry professionals to connect with!

        title: Do I  need a team?
        description: >
          Nope! Submissions can have 1-4 members, and we'll also have a
          team-building event at the start of the hackathon.

        title: Do I need coding experience?
        description: >
          No! Tribehacks is designed for students of all skill levels to learn
          and have fun. All you need for Tribehacks is yourself and your brain!
          Additionally, there will be mentors available throughout the weekend
          for help.

        title: Can I start on my project before the hackathon?
        description: >
          Generally, no. The judging criteria assumes that you are starting with
          just an idea at the beginning of the weekend! We do allow hackers to
          continue projects from before Tribehacks, but we require that you be
          clear about what work you did before the event.

        title: What if I don't do a project, or I don't finish?
        description: >
          You don't have to submit a project to participate! Tribehacks is all
          about learning and having fun while doing so. You can come just for
          our interesting workshops and talks, to hang out with your friends, or
          to compete!
